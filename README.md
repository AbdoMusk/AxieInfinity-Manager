# How Its Work

## Installation :
Developers:
  If you want to edit/use code source get your Exchange Rate API_KEY at : https://app.exchangerate-api.com/ , then paste it into currency_api_key *variable* (under CurrencyExchanger *class*, update_conversion_rate *function*)

Users:
  Download the repository or only the executable "AxieInfinity_Manager.exe", put it in a directory and run it.

## Usage
You navigate pages by choosing a number from command list.

## Pages :
Main -> Enter currency/cryptocurrency exchanger. || Enter inventory.

Currency Exchanger -> you can swape from USD to MAD | from MAD to USD | from SLP to USDT | from USDT to SLP.
                      Notice: when you made a swape the value is copied into your clipboard, so you can use it later.
                      
Inventory -> Show your inventory (shows your capital investment, earning and the remaining you have to earn in order to reach your initial capital) || Edit your capital investment || Add your earning from the game || Add SLP earning to your inventory doesn't have an effect on remaining.
             Notice: there's no currency preference the amounts are saved as you enter them (that's why exchanger exist).
